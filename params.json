The user can flick or use the arrow buttons to scroll. An autoscroll option is also provided.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- jQuery 2.0.3 (other versions might work too)\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICKSTART\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Add the following lines at the end of your ```<BODY>```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"vnd/jogwheel.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n```\r\n> (of course, if you already have jQuery on your site, you should omit the first line.)\r\n\r\n- add class=\"jogwheel\" to all the elements you wish to make jogwheel wrappers from.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTIONS\r\n-------\r\n\r\njogwheel.js has a few global options you can set to modify it's appearence. Values shown here are the defaults.\r\n```\r\njogwheel.velocity = 50;\r\n```\r\n> Flick inertia amount. Smaller number means less inertia.\r\n\r\n```\r\njogwheel.speed = 400;\r\n```\r\n> Flick inertia decay speed. Smaller number makes flicks stop faster\r\n\r\n```\r\njogwheel.keyspeed = 100;\r\n```\r\n> Length of transition in milliseconds when using arrow keys to scroll\r\n\r\n```\r\njogwheel.crawlspeed = 50;\r\n```\r\n> Controls the crawl speed by setting the delay between each pixel of crawling\r\n\r\n```\r\njogwheel.crawl = false;\r\n```\r\n> Autoscroll will be activated if set to true\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n  jogwheel.crawl = true;\r\n  jogwheel.keyspeed = 300;\r\n  jogwheel.speed = 100;\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nVERSION NOTES\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n- jogwheel.js was developed using Chrome. It's also been briefly tested with Firefox and IE 10. Arrow key navigation doesn't seem to work with IE.\r\n- Touch device navigation should work for devices which support it.\r\n- Minimal testing has been performed. Should you encounter any bugs, please send a detailed report to thykka@gmail.com. At the very least, include your browser, operating system and any possible developer console output.\r\n\r\nTASKS\r\n-----\r\n- [ ] Settings should be html parameters, instead of modifying the jogwheel object\r\n- [ ] Ensure compatibility with mobile devices.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI don't care how you use this script. I really don't. Feel free to use it, modify it, derive from it, sell it, distribute it, print it out with a font size equivalent of a small cat, whatever.
